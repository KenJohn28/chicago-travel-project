            <h3>Chicago, the city in a garden</h3>
            <p>
              Chicago, founded in 1833, grew rapidly due to its strategic
              location as a transportation hub with railroads and waterways
              connecting the East and West. It played a significant role in
              industrialization, the meatpacking industry, and the Great
              Migration. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 led to a massive
              rebuilding effort, resulting in pioneering architecture, including
              the world's first skyscraper.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chicago is known as "The City in a Garden" (Urbs in Horto) due to
              its commitment to green spaces, a vision set by early city
              planners. With over 600 parks, including Grant Park, Lincoln Park,
              and the iconic Millennium Park, the city integrates nature into
              its urban environment, making it a model for balancing
              urbanization with green living.
